# Change Risk Autopilot

A portfolio demo for change management with transparent risk scoring.

## What is this
Teams repeat outages because changes are approved without learning from incident history.
This app assigns a risk score and explains why.

## Tech
- GitHub Pages frontend (index.html, styles.css, content.js, app.js)
- SQL design included in /sql (PostgreSQL schema + seed data)

## Run
Open `index.html` locally or enable GitHub Pages:
Settings -> Pages -> Deploy from branch -> main -> /root

## Notes
This demo stores data in browser localStorage.
The SQL folder shows the real backend schema for a future API.
